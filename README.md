In this part several steps are done:

## docker
 I have added a Dockerfile to creat an image with our script

``` bash
$ docker buildx build ./ -t read_links

### Security check

I have cheked my image with the tool [trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy).
First, my image was using `python:3.12-slim`, and the check showed:

```
read_links (debian 12.11)

Total: 101 (UNKNOWN: 1, LOW: 74, MEDIUM: 18, HIGH: 7, CRITICAL: 1)
```
With the critical vulnerability found in the `zlib1g` library.

Vulnerability: CVE-2023-45853 | Status: will_not_fix â”‚ Installed Version: 1:1.2.13.dfsg-1 | [zlib: integer overflow and resultant heap-based buffer overflow in zipOpenNewFileInZip4_6...](https://avd.aquasec.com/nvd/cve-2023-45853)
 
After I switched to the python:3.12-alpine (alpine 3.22.0), trivy check showed no problems, vulnerabilities were not found.

## kubernetes

Our script is a one-off tasks that run to completion and then stop. This sounds like a perfect opportunity to use the Job of kubernetes to run our task and stop the pod once execution is finished. I decided this is a more suitable solution than adding an infinite sleep to the script. After launching the cluster, we can execute the job:
``` bash
$ kubectl apply -f k8s_job.yaml
```

Then we can find the pod that executed the job and find it's output in the logs [like shown here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/)

### improvements:

* **args**: with the current implementation we cannot really pass the arguments with URLs. A better solution would be to set them in the ConfigMap object for pods to read the URL from it. I would state one URL argument per job and execute several seperate jobs for several input URLs
* **image**: to be able to use the image we built, it needs to be uploaded to a registry
* **results**: we might want to implement the automated collection of results since they will be spreaded among different logs
